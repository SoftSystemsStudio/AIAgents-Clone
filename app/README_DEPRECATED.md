This `app/` directory has been migrated to `apps/agency-web/app/` as part of a repo re-organization.

Action items:
- The files under `app/` are duplicated under `apps/agency-web/app/` for a safe migration.
- Do not modify files under `app/` anymore. They are kept for reference during the migration.
- Once you confirm the new app in `apps/agency-web` works as expected, the `app/` directory can be removed in a follow-up commit.

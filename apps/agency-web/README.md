# agency-web (Next.js) — Intake + Admin + Demos

This folder will contain the product-facing web application (Next.js) for the AI Automation Agency.

Purpose:
- Intake form (multi-step) to collect client data
- Admin dashboard to inspect `ClientConfig` and generate briefs/proposals
- Lightweight demos (support chat, content generator)

Notes:
- For now this is a scaffold. We will move the existing `app/` Next.js code here in a later, controlled step.
- Keep builds and deps isolated to this folder after the migration.

# Running the scaffolded `agency-web` app

This folder contains a minimal Next.js scaffold. It does not yet contain the migrated app code.

To run locally after migration:

1. Install dependencies inside `apps/agency-web`:

```bash
cd apps/agency-web
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After we move the existing `app/` code into this folder, this will be the primary web app for the product.
